This repor is where I save my leet code solutions, I mainly store my first attempts which pass all the tests in leet code website, except for time/space complexity test.

This because as it may need a more advanced knowleadge than what I currently have, and I believe the you should solve the problem first and optimize it later.

For example, if a problem could be solved with arrays, it does not make sense to solve it with hashmap for the most optimal solution, especially if it's my first few problems and I haven't learn hashmap yet.

I might create a separate repo where can I save the most optimal solutions, but that will be in a later time.
